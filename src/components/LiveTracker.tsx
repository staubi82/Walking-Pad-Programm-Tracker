Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```typescript
export const LiveTracker: React.FC<LiveTrackerProps> = ({ onSessionComplete, isRecording, onRecordingChange }) => {
  // ... [all existing code remains the same until the end]

  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* ... [all existing JSX remains the same] */}
    </div>
  );
}; // Added missing closing bracket for LiveTracker component
```

The main issue was a missing closing curly brace `}` at the very end of the file to close the LiveTracker component definition. The rest of the code appears to be properly balanced with brackets.
